This repository showcases a common coding error in Python that can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug problems.  The code includes example functions that can raise a ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, and other exceptions.  The primary focus is on an uncommon error: masking exceptions by using a generic `except Exception` block after handling specific exception types, such as `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError`. This practice makes debugging challenging, as it prevents detailed error messages from reaching the user or log files. The solution demonstrates a more robust approach to error handling, highlighting how to handle specific exception types to provide context-aware error messages and how to separate general exception handling for cases when the error is truly unexpected.
